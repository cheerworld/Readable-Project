# Readable Project

This is the project for Udacity's React & Redux course. I build a React/Redux front end for the application. I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [React-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) to bootstrap this project.

## Get Started

* To get this project, type `git clone https://github.com/cheerworld/Readable-Project.git` in your terminal and `cd Readable-Project` into your project.

To get started developing right away:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd reactnd-project-readable-starter/api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window
    - `cd readable-frontend`
    - install all project dependencies with `npm install/yarn add`
    - start the development server with `npm/yarn start`

## App View

There are 4 ways for you to sort posts, it includes sort by highest or lowest votes and sort by latest or oldest date. You can click on each post to view the details of each post. There is a navigation bar at the top of each view. You can navigate to home, to an individual category, and to create a post.
